# GGJ2025 - Bubble Rush

This is a game made for Global Game Jam 2025

We participated in the jam hosted in Timișoara, Romania. This year's theme was "bubble".

The game is a first-person 3D platformer featuring Y2K aesthetics (bubble pop, Frutiger Aero, late 90's Japan). The goal of the game is to traverse the different maps and reach the end by jumping from bubble platform to bubble platform.
